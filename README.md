# Technical test

In this app, you will be asked to develop a front end client to a basic banking api.
You will develop features one by one. Focus will be put on code quality, rather than coding pace.

You are expected to deliver documented and unit-tested code unless you are asked not to.

## Developer guide

### Start the project

```
yarn
yarn start
```

### Run tests
```
yarn test
```


## Features

### Fetch the account balance from an API

For now, the account balance is fixed. You need to fetch it from an API to be able to retrieve the correct value.

You may use any http library you want or directly use fetch.

### Deposit money on the account

Now, you will be asked to add a feature to deposit money on the account.

### Withdraw money from the account

You may now add a feature to withdraw money from the account. You need to implement a visual display if the user
withdraws more money than he has on his account.
